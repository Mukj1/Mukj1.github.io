## Introduction

This study examines how immersion influences tourists’ revisit intention to the Beijing Winter Olympic venue “Snow Ruyi,” focusing on the psychological mechanism through place attachment. Grounded in the cognitive–affective–conative (CAC) framework, it conceptualizes immersion as an active cognitive process that shapes emotional bonds and behavioral outcomes.

> Olympic legacy venues can create long-term tourism value, but their post-event utilization depends on understanding visitors’ emotional and behavioral responses.

## Methodology

1. Data: survey collected from visitors to “Snow Ruyi” using snowball sampling, 433 valid responses.  
2. Key variables: immersion, place attachment, revisit intention; control variables include skiing experience and visit frequency.  
3. Modeling: structural equation modeling using AMOS; confirmatory factor analysis for reliability and validity; multi-group analysis to test generational differences.  

## Results

1. Immersion positively influences place attachment (β≈0.36).  
2. Place attachment positively influences revisit intention (β≈0.36).  
3. Place attachment significantly mediates the relationship between immersion and revisit intention (indirect effect ≈0.13).  
4. Control variables (skiing experience, visit frequency) are not significant.  
5. Generational cohort (Gen X, Y, Z) does not significantly moderate the relationships.

## Key Insight

Immersive experiences function as a cognitive entry point that strengthens emotional attachment to Olympic legacy venues, which in turn drives revisit intention.

## Contributions

1. Extends the CAC model by positioning immersion as an active cognitive process rather than a passive stimulus.  
2. Demonstrates the psychological pathway from immersive experience → emotional attachment → behavioral intention in Olympic legacy tourism.  
3. Shows that generational differences play a limited role compared to cognitive immersion in shaping revisit behavior.

## Managerial Implications

1. Enhance immersive experiences (interactive routes, AR/VR, narrative design) to deepen cognitive engagement.  
2. Strengthen emotional bonds through cultural symbolism, storytelling, and memory-based experiences.  
3. Use tourism activation strategies to sustain the long-term value and utilization of Olympic legacy venues.
