## FOMO in the AI Boom

I have been struggling with FOMO (fear of missing out) during this explosive period of AI development. Every day, I am surrounded by new and novel tools. From the rise of skills to the viral spread of tools like Clawdbot and Moltbot, countless new products appear almost daily. I keep trying to understand them one by one, because I do not want to be left behind.

Human energy is limited. More importantly, I need to identify value and distinguish the value of knowing a tool from the value of using it.Not every tool is worth adopting. Everyone has unique use cases, and for me, out of ten thousand new tools, maybe only two are truly worth using. The rest are only worth understanding at a high level.

I am trying to fully internalize this point and stay grounded: in the turbulence of rapid technological change, I want to focus on finding the tools that genuinely fit my own work.
