## Introduction

This study explains why Chinese consumers are shifting preference from foreign sportswear brands to domestic ones, focusing on Confucian yuanfen based brand relationship quality (CYR) and its spillover effects. It argues that relationship strength with one domestic brand can extend to evaluations of the broader domestic sportswear category and related beliefs.

> Traditional brand relationship research may miss culturally specific relational logics that drive preference shifts in China.

## Methodology

1. Data: online survey via Wenjuanwang, snowball sampling among sports participants, 326 valid responses.  
2. Key variables: CYR, product origin image, domestic sportswear brand preference, consumer xenocentrism.  
3. Modeling: CYR treated as a second order reflective formative construct; hypotheses tested with SmartPLS 4.0 using PLS SEM.  

## Results

1. CYR formative dimensions supported: interaction belief, intimate interaction, happiness.  
2. CYR formative dimensions not supported: emotional expression, tolerance.  
3. Structural paths supported:  
   3.1 CYR increases product origin image.  
   3.2 CYR increases domestic sportswear brand preference.  
   3.3 Product origin image increases domestic sportswear brand preference.  
4. Mediation: product origin image significantly mediates the CYR to brand preference link and accounts for about 44 percent of the total effect.  
5. Moderation: consumer xenocentrism does not significantly weaken the spillover effect.  

## Key Insight

A yuanfen style relationship with one domestic sportswear brand can spill over to stronger product origin image and broader category level preference for domestic sportswear brands.

## Contributions

1. Provides a China specific measurement and modeling of brand relationship quality via Confucian yuanfen.  
2. Extends spillover research by showing a love me love my dog pattern in consumer brand relationships at the category level.  
3. Clarifies the role of product origin image as a key psychological transmission channel in preference shifting.  

## Managerial Implications

1. Manage relationships for long term development, prioritizing interaction belief, intimate interaction, and consumer happiness.  
2. Reinforce product origin associations to amplify the feedback loop between brand relationships and origin image.  
3. Domestic brands can explore co-opetition because positive relational spillover may lift the whole domestic category.
