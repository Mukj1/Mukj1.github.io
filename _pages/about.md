After completing my undergraduate and master's degrees at Beijing Sport University, I am currently taking a gap year and preparing for my PhD application.

I am a researcher in sport management, and I am also a sports enthusiast. I enjoy outdoor activities, especially hiking and cycling. Additionally, I am an esports fan and I am particularly fond of CS.

My interests are diverse, ranging from rock music—whether it's Midwest emo or post-punk—to fashion, especially the fusion of sports and style. I welcome communication across various fields and am always eager to learn and explore different worlds.

Research Interests
-----
My research focuses on sports experiences and sportswear branding. Building on this, I am particularly interested in the intersection of sports, environmental protection, and sustainability. By employing various methods, including both qualitative and quantitative methods, I aim to advance our understanding of the relationship between sports and the environment.
